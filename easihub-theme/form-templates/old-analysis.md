  Key Technical Features

  Field Detection System

  - Examples: /Add\s+Event/, /Share\s+Use\s+Case/, /Post\s+Job/

  Responsive Design

  - Mobile-first responsive breakpoints (768px, 480px)
  - Flexbox layouts that collapse to single column on mobile
  - Consistent styling across all composer types

  DOM Manipulation

  - Custom field injection after .d-editor-textarea-wrapper
  - Dynamic label creation and placeholder modification
  - Tip boxes with expandable help content

  Data Handling

  - Form data serialization into markdown format before submission
  - File upload handling for thumbnails and logos
  - Date field validation and formatting

  Performance Optimizations

  - DOM caching to reduce repeated queries
  - requestAnimationFrame for better rendering performance
  - Interval cleanup on page unload

  The code shows a sophisticated multi-composer system where different field sets
  are dynamically injected based on the content type being created, with
  consistent UX patterns but specialized fields for each use case.
