          header: ðŸ’¡ Need help asking a great question?
          content: |
            A great question includes software and technical context 
            (e.g., SAP S/4HANA, Salesforce API), the exact error or 
            scenario, and what you've already tried.

            **Example:** "How can I enable OAuth between Salesforce and Azure AD? 
            I configured the connected app but keep getting 'invalid grant'. 
            I tried updating callback URL and resetting secrets."

            Ask clearly, and others can help you faster.

          content: |
            Bulletins are ideal for quick product updates, release announcements, 
            security advisories, or breaking system news. Keep it short and focused. 
            You may link to an external bulletin or summarize it.

            **Example:** "Salesforce Spring '25 release adds native GraphQL support"

            Discussions explore open-ended ideas, trade-offs, or product strategies. 
            You can frame your discussion around a domain, a product, or a technical topic.

            **Example 1:** "What are pros/cons of integrating Salesforce with Azure AD vs Okta?"
            **Example 2:** "Which data model is better for variant BOMs in Teamcenter: structure or classification?"
