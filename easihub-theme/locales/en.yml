          header: ðŸ’¡ Need help asking a great question?
          content: |
            A great question includes software and technical context 
            (e.g., SAP S/4HANA, Salesforce API), the exact error or 
            scenario, and what you've already tried.

            **Example:** "How can I enable OAuth between Salesforce and Azure AD? 
            I configured the connected app but keep getting 'invalid grant'. 
            I tried updating callback URL and resetting secrets."

            Ask clearly, and others can help you faster.

        bulletins:
          header: ðŸ’¡ Need help writing a bulletin?
          content: |
            Bulletins are ideal for quick product updates, release announcements, 
            security advisories, or breaking system news. Keep it short and focused. 
            You may link to an external bulletin or summarize it.

            **Example:** "Salesforce Spring '25 release adds native GraphQL support"

        discussion:
          header: ðŸ’¡ Need help structuring your discussion? 
          content: |
            Discussions explore open-ended ideas, trade-offs, or product strategies. 
            You can frame your discussion around a domain, a product, or a technical topic.

            **Example 1:** "What are pros/cons of integrating Salesforce with Azure AD vs Okta?"
            **Example 2:** "Which data model is better for variant BOMs in Teamcenter: structure or classification?"

            Use this form when you're looking to spark thoughtful conversation and input from others.
        
        events:
          header: ðŸ’¡ Need help listing your event?
          content: |

            or community events. Be sure to include the title, software or domain 
            it relates to, the event type, and a URL or agenda.

        jobs:
          header: ðŸ’¡ Need help writing a quality job post?
          content: |
            Use specific job titles, domain/software (e.g., SAP, Salesforce, Teamcenter),
            and include work mode, job type, and contact info. Add certifications, 
            benefits, or URLs to make the job clear and attractive.

            **Example:** "Teamcenter Integration Consultant (Remote, Contract) with 5+ years experience"

            Use cases share real implementations across domains, software, or technical areas.

            **Example 1:** "Automated Teamcenter-to-SAP BOM transfer using REST API"
            **Example 2:** "Used Salesforce Flow Builder to auto-update opportunity stages"

          header: ðŸ’¡ Need help writing effective feedback?
          content: |
            Feedback helps improve products, processes, or community experiences. 
            Be specific about what you're commenting on, what works well, 
            and what could be improved. Include context and actionable suggestions.

            **Example:** "The new Salesforce integration wizard is intuitive, 
            but the OAuth setup step needs clearer error messages when credentials fail."

            Constructive feedback drives better outcomes for everyone.
