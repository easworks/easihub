          content: |
            A great question includes software and technical context 
            (e.g., SAP S/4HANA, Salesforce API), the exact error or 
            scenario, and what you've already tried.

            **Example:** "How can I enable OAuth between Salesforce and Azure AD? 
            I configured the connected app but keep getting 'invalid grant'. 
            I tried updating callback URL and resetting secrets."

            Ask clearly, and others can help you faster.
