          header: ðŸ’¡ Need help asking a great question?
          content: |
            A great question includes software and technical context 
            (e.g., SAP S/4HANA, Salesforce API), the exact error or 
            scenario, and what you've already tried.

            **Example:** "How can I enable OAuth between Salesforce and Azure AD? 
            I configured the connected app but keep getting 'invalid grant'. 
            I tried updating callback URL and resetting secrets."

            Ask clearly, and others can help you faster.

            or community events. Be sure to include the title, software or domain 
            it relates to, the event type, and a URL or agenda.

        jobs:
          header: ðŸ’¡ Need help writing a quality job post?

            Use specific job titles, domain/software (e.g., SAP, Salesforce, Teamcenter),
            and include work mode, job type, and contact info. Add certifications, 
            benefits, or URLs to make the job clear and attractive.

            **Example:** "Teamcenter Integration Consultant (Remote, Contract) with 5+ years experience"

        bulletins:
          header: ðŸ’¡ Need help writing a bulletin?
          content: |
            Bulletins are ideal for quick product updates, release announcements, 
            security advisories, or breaking system news. Keep it short and focused. 
            You may link to an external bulletin or summarize it.

            **Example:** "Salesforce Spring '25 release adds native GraphQL support"
