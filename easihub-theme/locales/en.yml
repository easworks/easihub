          content: |
            A great question includes software and technical context 
            (e.g., SAP S/4HANA, Salesforce API), the exact error or 
            scenario, and what you've already tried.

            **Example:** "How can I enable OAuth between Salesforce and Azure AD? 
            I configured the connected app but keep getting 'invalid grant'. 
            I tried updating callback URL and resetting secrets."

            Ask clearly, and others can help you faster.

        bulletins:
          header: ðŸ’¡ Need help writing a bulletin?
          content: |
            Bulletins are ideal for quick product updates, release announcements, 
            security advisories, or breaking system news. Keep it short and focused. 
            You may link to an external bulletin or summarize it.

            **Example:** "Salesforce Spring '25 release adds native GraphQL support"

        discussion:
          header: ðŸ’¡ Need help structuring your discussion?

            Discussions explore open-ended ideas, trade-offs, or product strategies. 
            You can frame your discussion around a domain, a product, or a technical topic.

            **Example 1:** "What are pros/cons of integrating Salesforce with Azure AD vs Okta?"
            **Example 2:** "Which data model is better for variant BOMs in Teamcenter: structure or classification?"

            Use this form when you're looking to spark thoughtful conversation and input from others.

            or community events. Be sure to include the title, software or domain 
            it relates to, the event type, and a URL or agenda.

            and include work mode, job type, and contact info. Add certifications, 
            benefits, or URLs to make the job clear and attractive.

          header: ðŸ’¡ Need help writing effective feedback?
          content: |
            Feedback helps improve products, processes, or community experiences. 
            Be specific about what you're commenting on, what works well, 
            and what could be improved. Include context and actionable suggestions.

            **Example:** "The new Salesforce integration wizard is intuitive, 
            but the OAuth setup step needs clearer error messages when credentials fail."

            Constructive feedback drives better outcomes for everyone.
